## ðŸš€ Quick Solution (Do This Now):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Ibrahim-Refaay"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Get a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
   - Create new token with "repo" permissions
   - Copy the token

3. **Push with correct authentication**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\HR-PC\Music\last-flask\last-flask"
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   - Username: `Ibrahim-Refaay` (with hyphen!)
   - Password: [Your Personal Access Token]

## ðŸ”§ Why This Happened:

- Your Git was configured with username `IbrahimRefaay` (no hyphen)
- But your GitHub account is `Ibrahim-Refaay` (with hyphen)
- GitHub rejected the push because the usernames didn't match

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:

1. âœ… Use the quick fix above
2. âœ… Bookmark the troubleshooting guides for future issues
3. âœ… Run `./git-diagnostic.sh` if you have more problems
4. âœ… Consider setting up SSH keys for better security (see the full guide)

- Verify your GitHub account name matches exactly
- Use the diagnostic script to find other issues
